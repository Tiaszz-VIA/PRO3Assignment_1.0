Slaughterhouse Project Overview
1. Introduction
This project involves building a gRPC-based slaughterhouse management system that interfaces with a PostgreSQL database. The system allows users to retrieve information about animals and products related to the slaughterhouse.

2. gRPC and Protobuf
gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is a high-performance RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework that allows different systems to communicate efficiently. In this project, gRPC is used to enable communication between clients and the slaughterhouse backend system.

Protobuf (Protocol Buffers) is used for serializing structured data. It is a language-neutral, platform-neutral, and extensible way of serializing data. Protobuf files (.proto) are used to define the service and message types for communication in gRPC.

3. System Components
The project is divided into several components:

SlaughterhouseServiceImpl: The main service implementation where the business logic resides. This includes methods to retrieve information about animals and products.
DatabaseUtil: A utility class that manages connections to the PostgreSQL database.
PostgreSQL Database: The backend data store where all information about animals and products is stored.
BloomRPC: A client application used to test the gRPC services.
4. PostgreSQL Database
The PostgreSQL database is used to store the data for the slaughterhouse system. The database consists of two main tables:

animal: This table stores information about animals, including their registration number and type.
product: This table stores information about products, including the parts of the animal.
The database is organized under a schema called slaughterhouse, and proper permissions are granted to ensure that the application user can interact with the database.

5. Schema and Permissions Setup
The following SQL commands are used to set up the schema and grant necessary permissions:

Create the schema: CREATE SCHEMA slaughterhouse;
Create the tables for storing animal and product data: CREATE TABLE slaughterhouse.animal (...); CREATE TABLE slaughterhouse.product (...);
Grant the necessary permissions to the application user: GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA slaughterhouse TO your_username;
6. Troubleshooting Common Errors
Common errors encountered during the development process include:

Relation does not exist: This occurs when PostgreSQL cannot find the specified table. It is often caused by case-sensitivity or incorrect schema references.
Permission denied: This occurs when the application user lacks the necessary privileges to access certain tables or schemas. The solution is to grant the appropriate permissions.
7. Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to use gRPC with PostgreSQL to create a scalable and efficient backend service. By following proper setup procedures, including schema creation and permission management, the system can handle requests for animal and product data effectively.
